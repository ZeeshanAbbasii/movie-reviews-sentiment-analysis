## 🧠 What It Does

- Cleans and preprocesses movie reviews
- Trains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for sentiment classification
- Saves the trained model and vectorizer using `pickle`
- Allows interactive sentiment prediction for new reviews
- Evaluates model using a confusion matrix

## ▶️ How to Run

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie_review_sentiment.git
   cd movie_review_sentiment

2.	Install dependencies:

	pip install -r requirements.txt

3.	Run the notebook:
Open cleaned_notebook.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook and run all cells.

4.	Make predictions interactively:
Use the provided predict_interactive() function to enter reviews and get real-time sentiment predictions.

⸻

🧪 Evaluation
	•	Model is evaluated using a confusion matrix.
	•	Accuracy, precision, and recall are calculated.
	•	You may extend the evaluation to include ROC curve and AUC if desired.
